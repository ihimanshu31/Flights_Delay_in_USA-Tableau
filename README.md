Udacity Project#1 for Data Visualization Nanodegree.

Project 1 - Intro to Data Visualization course project
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
